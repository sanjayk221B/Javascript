## Key Concepts

### What is Error Handling?
Error handling is the process of responding to and recovering from errors in a program. In JavaScript, errors can occur due to syntax issues, unexpected runtime behavior, or invalid user inputs.

### Why is Error Handling Important?
- Prevents applications from crashing.
- Provides meaningful feedback to users.
- Ensures smoother user experience.
- Helps identify and fix bugs during development.

### Types of Errors in JavaScript
1. **Syntax Errors**: Mistakes in code syntax that prevent execution.
2. **Runtime Errors**: Errors that occur during program execution.
3. **Logical Errors**: Code runs without crashing but produces incorrect results.

### Best Practices
- Anticipate potential errors and plan how to handle them.
- Use `try...catch` for controlled error handling.
- Avoid silent failures by logging errors.
- Test edge cases thoroughly to minimize unexpected issues.

## Exercises
To practice error handling concepts, work on the exercises in the **[08_error_exercises.js](./08_error_exercises.js)** file. These exercises will challenge you to debug code, handle asynchronous errors, and write custom error-handling logic.
